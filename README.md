# myfoodapp

By the end of this project we will have a fully working system . An admin dashboard where the restaurant's team can upload the available food and everyday's 
menu as well as they can delete and customise what can be visible to the customer . Also they can assign delivery person to deliver the order.

We will have a customer mobile application . the user can use it to see the available menu and order what he wants .

we will have a delivery app which the delivery man can accept or reject a delivery as well as he can see the location of the customer 
and the path to him using google map API .
